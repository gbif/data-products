## Data Gaps

> A **data gap** is an area either geographic or taxonomic in which the GBIF network is missing data. 

## Background 

GBIF participant nodes are often looking for guidance about what data is needed or information about how to prioritize data publishing to GBIF. This is a difficult question for GBIF to answer. GBIF largely aggregates data about what is **known** about a region or taxonomic group. What is **unknown** is **unknown**.  

## Definitional shortcomings 

One person's gap is not another person's gap. Missing data from a genus of reptiles might seem like a very big gap for someone who researches reptiles, but having no occurrences from an entire family of diptera might not seem like a big gap. So priorities and gaps are **subjective**. This make guidance on how to fill gaps difficult from a neutral perspective. 

Usually, when people are discussing data gaps, they mean of things most people care about. Or **important things** things like perhaps charismatic mammals, birds, reptiles, but not plankton (If you are a plankton researcher, you might mean plankton). So telling a node with limited budget and time that they have no plankton records in their country or another 100 groups is informational overload. The challenge is summarizing the information to avoid informational overload in a way that is both informative but not misleading. 

For example, Switzerland publishes almost no bird occurrence records. It does however have many insect records, is there a bird data gap in Switzerland? Should Switzerland not prioritize insect records in the future? 

Additionally, gaps research 

There are many gaps in many areas. 

## Approaches to identifying what is missing:

* Neighboring countries
* Checklists 
* IUCN range maps 
* SDM
