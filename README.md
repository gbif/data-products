## Data Quality

### Metadata
In order to get quality metadata, we would like to identify:
* what we have
* what we are missing
* what can be improved

The metadata folder contains scripts and files generated using the [GBIF registry API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/registry) to retrieve and visualise information about about metadata's datasets.
The goal is to get an overview of the quality of metadata.

Recommendations to improve metadata quality will be written in this repository's wiki.
