This query lists the download events, sum of downloaded records that users downloaded between specific dates.
Excluded are deleted publishers and deleted datasets. Also excluded are downloads from @gbif.org addresses and where there is no filter i.e. full index downloads assuming most of these are mistakes.

    SELECT count(dod.download_key) AS download_event, sum(dod.number_records) AS download_records, o.title AS organization, d.title AS title, concat('http://www.gbif.org/dataset/',d.key) FROM occurrence_download od 
    JOIN dataset_occurrence_download dod ON od.key = dod.download_key
    JOIN dataset d ON d.key = dod.dataset_key
