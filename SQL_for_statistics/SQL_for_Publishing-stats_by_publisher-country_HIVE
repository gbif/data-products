This SQL works only in HIVE and it produces the number of records shared by _publisher country_.

     SELECT count(*) AS CT, publishingcountry FROM occurrence_hdfs WHERE to_date(from_unixtime(CAST(fragmentcreated/1000 AS int))) BETWEEN '%(start)s' AND '%(end)s'
     GROUP BY publishingcountry ORDER BY CT DESC
     
SQL for year-end stats would look like this:

     SELECT count(*) AS CT, publishingcountry FROM occurrence_hdfs WHERE to_date(from_unixtime(CAST(fragmentcreated/1000 AS int))) < '2020-01-01'
     GROUP BY publishingcountry ORDER BY CT DESC
