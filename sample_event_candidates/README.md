# Identifiying datasets of type (Sample Event)

The mission is to enable users to identify datasets most relevant to their purpose. Tagging or categorizing the GBIF datasets will enable our effort to make this kind of filtering possible.
Initially all datasets in GBIF should be parsed by using a range of keywords that signify a sampling event dataset.
These can be ['plot', 'transect', 'trap', 'trawl'] and I used these for the prototyping.

The repository for these terms is this:
