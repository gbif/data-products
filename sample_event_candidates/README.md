# Identifiying datasets of type (Sample Event)

The mission is to enable users to identify datasets most relevant to their purpose. Tagging or categorizing the GBIF datasets will serve as a launchpad for our effort to make this kind of filtering possible. Example: "Give me all records from sediment-corer type samples"
Initially all datasets in GBIF should be parsed by using a range of keywords that signify a sampling event dataset.
These can be ['plot', 'transect', 'trap', 'trawl'] and I used these for the prototyping.

The repository for these terms is this:

Once there is a pool of terms such as the simple ones mentioned above|
